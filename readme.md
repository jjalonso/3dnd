Tomorrow, Augmented Reality
--------

Google just released ARCore (Java)
Apple just released ARKit (Objetive-C)

On web, Mozilla and Chrome are working on a new standard, WebVR. 
A common API to develop VR experiences, but... not AR.

WebAR is a prototype started by Google that works on Android and iOS using specific browsers

WebARonARKit for WebAR on ARKit (iOS)
WebARonARCore for WebAR on ARCore (Android)

This browsers are able to run a ThreeJS helper provided by Google to recognise surfaces, a AR camera projection and few more classes.
